This is the Imam Linear List, a simple linked list implementation library
for storing data structures and data lists into the heap memory.

Please read Intro for a detail description and example.

There are example programs in the examples directory and also have a look at the imamll.h header file for a better understanding of the library. 

imamLL is written in C, but should work with C++ natively.

To install imamLL, execute build.sh script in the terminal.

After installing the library to compile your code using gcc just add -limamll in the compile command, e.g: gcc -Wall -o main main.c -limamll

This library is distributed under zlib license. Please read License for more information

Enjoy!
